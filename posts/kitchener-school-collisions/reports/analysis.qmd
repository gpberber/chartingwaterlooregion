## All Collisions Near Schools

@tbl-all-coll-near-sch reports the number of collisions of any type that occurred within 250m of a school, with the number of pedestrian and cyclist collisions broken out from all other types of collisions.

## Collisions by Type of Day and Time of Day

In @tbl-by-day-type, collisions are broken down by the type of day they occurred on and the time of day they occurred.

## Collisions per Day

To facilitate proper comparisons across types of day, @tbl-colls-per-day reports the mean number of collisions per day for each day type and time period.

## Overall Trend in Pedestrian Collisions

In @fig-ped-by-year-all-days we see that the total number of pedestrian collisions has been steadily decreasing since 2015.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ped-by-year-all-days
#| fig-cap: "Total pedestrian collisions per year"

all_collisions |> 
  filter(pedestrianinvolved) |> 
  mutate(accident_year = as.character(accident_year)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = accident_year)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "count", fill = "purple4", width = 0.5) +
    geom_text(
      stat = "count", 
      aes(label = after_stat(count)),
      position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
      vjust = 1.5,
      colour = "white"
    ) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(

    labs(
      x = "", 
      y = "",
      subtitle = "(2022 data to July 31 only)"
      )

```

## Total Collisions by Type of Traffic Control in Place

In @fig-traffic-control-all-ped-collisions we see that about half of all pedestrian collisions occurred at locations with some type of traffic control in place.

```{r}
#| label: fig-traffic-control-all-ped-collisions
#| fig-cap: "Total pedestrian collisions by traffic control type"

all_collisions |> 
  filter(pedestrianinvolved) |>

    geom_bar(fill = "purple4", width = 0.7) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = function(x) seq(0, ceiling(x[2]), by = 10)) +
    geom_text(stat = "count", 
              aes(label = after_stat(count)),
              position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
              hjust = -0.5) +

      y = "",
      subtitle = "(2022 data to July 31 only)"
    )
```

## Map of School Collisions

The interactive map in @fig-map-collisions reports the types and number of collisions that took place on a school day between 6AM and 6PM within 250m of schools in Kitchener. Hover over a bubble to see the school name and click on it to see collision details. A bubble with a number indicates multiple underlying schools. Click on it to zoom in and see bubbles for the individual schools.

```{r}
#| label: fig-map-collisions
#| fig-cap: "Collisions within 250m of a school on regular school days from 6am-6pm"

map <- collisions_btw_6am_6pm |>
