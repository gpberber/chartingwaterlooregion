## Overall Trend in Pedestrian Collisions

In @fig-ped-by-year-all-days we see that the number of pedestrian collisions per year has been steadily decreasing since 2015.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ped-by-year-all-days

```

## Pedestrian Collisions by Type of Traffic Control at Collision Location

In @fig-traffic-control-all-ped-collisions we see that just over half (129/231 or 56%) of all pedestrian collisions occurred at <span style="color: #551A8B; font-weight: bold;">locations with some type of traffic control in place</span>.

## Pedestrian Collisions Near Schools

@tbl-schped reports the schools that had at least one pedestrian collision within 250m. In total there were 28 pedestrian collisions within 250m of a school (one of these occurred within 250m of two schools, so the number of collisions below add to 29).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-schped

```

## Pedestrian Collisions per Year by School Proximity

@fig-ped-by-year compares the number of pedestrian collisions inside and outside the 250m boundary of schools on regular school days (i.e., days schools were not locked down due to the pandemic). As with total pedestrian collisions in @fig-ped-by-year-all-days above, we see steadily declining trends inside and outside the 250m boundary.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ped-by-year

## Collisions Near Schools by Type of Traffic Control

Consistent with @fig-traffic-control-all-ped-collisions above, @fig-traffic-control shows that just over half (15/28 or 54%) of pedestrian collisions near schools occurred at <span style="color: #551A8B; font-weight: bold;">locations with some type of traffic control in place</span>.

## All Collisions Near Schools

@tbl-all-coll-near-sch reports the number of collisions of any type that occurred within 250m of a school, with the number of pedestrian and cyclist collisions broken out from all other types of collisions. The vast majority (\~95%) of collisions near schools involve neither pedestrians nor cyclists.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-all-coll-near-sch

## Collisions by Type of Day and Time of Day

In @tbl-by-day-type, collisions are broken down by the type of day they occurred on and the time of day they occurred.

## Collisions per Day

To facilitate proper comparisons across types of day, @tbl-colls-per-day reports the mean number of collisions per day for each day type and time period.

## Collisions by School Proximity and Time of Day

@tbl-by-nearness-to-school reports the number of collisions inside and outside the 250m boundary, broken down by time of day.

## Map of School Collisions

The interactive map in @fig-map-collisions reports the types and number of collisions that took place on a school day between 6AM and 6PM within 250m of schools in Kitchener. Hover over a bubble to see the school name and click on it to see collision details. A bubble with a number indicates multiple underlying schools. Click on it to zoom in and see bubbles for the individual schools.

```{r}
#| label: fig-map-collisions
