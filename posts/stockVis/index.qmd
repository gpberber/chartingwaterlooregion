Welcome to my stock-price visualization tool!

![](thumbnail.jpg)

This simple tool pulls stock price data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) for the stock symbol and date range you specify (see the Yahoo Finance page to look up symbols for the stocks you wish to visualize).

You also have the option to view the prices on a logarithmic scale and to adjust the historical prices to their present values using CPI data from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).

Happy charting!
