I'm Greg and after almost 30 years of being on the internet, I've decided to start my first blog! I have no grand plan for it right now, but as its name suggests, it will feature posts focused on data analytics, likely a mix of tutorials and analysis of things I find interesting. Mainly, I suppose it's an outlet for me to indulge my analytics habit. And no, deadicated isn't spelled wrong, at least to people who've spent way too much time listening to [this band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead) over the years!
